## KiCad Footprints & 3D model

This repo contains KiCad footprints for:

- SMD Mounted Switches
- SMD Mounted Double-Sided
- Through-Hole Mounted (Hand Soldering)
- Through-Hole Mounted Double-Sided

**Please note that the double-sided mounts are still in the testing phase and might be subject to change.**

The repo also contains a 3D model of the switch [in a STEP format](https://github.com/pashutk/Cherry_MX_ULP/blob/main/Cherry_ULP.pretty/Cherry_MX_ULP.step). The model has limited dimensional precision and should only be used for visualization purposes.

## Datasheets

Although the datasheets we have currently are not highly detailed, they provide the essential specifications and information required for working with Cherry MX ULP switches. More comprehensive data will be added as they become available.

### Patents

For deeper understanding, it could be beneficial to look at related patents by Cherry. Although the following patent does not directly pertain to the exact model of the Cherry MX ULP switches, the general design principles are very similar:

- [Key module for a keyboard, and keyboard](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230154700A1/en?inventor=Eduard+Ruff&sort=new)

These patents can serve as great resources for technical understanding and innovation around switch designs.

## Keycaps

### Where to source

Acquiring the right keycaps for Cherry MX ULP switches involves several potential sources:

1. **Off-the-shelf Keyboards**: Keycaps can be harvested from the following keyboards:
    - [Corsair K100 AIR WIRELESS RGB Ultra-Thin Mechanical Gaming Keyboard](https://www.corsair.com/ww/en/p/keyboards/ch-913a01u-ch/k100-air-wireless-rgb-ultra-thin-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-cherry-mx-ultra-low-profile-tactile-ch-913a01u-ch)
    - [Cherry KW X ULP](https://www.cherryamericas.com/kw-x-ulp)
    - [Mistel Air One](http://mistelkeyboard.com/products/9a36520f591f4f8b8e1253abf6885b51)
    - [KeyPulse Elite](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1658898886/keypulse-elite-slim-mechanical-keyboards/description)

2. **Dell Alienware Laptop Keyboard Module**: This module can also be used as a donor for keycaps. You can find it [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005578673316.html?spm=a2g0o.order_detail.order_detail_item.2.2141f19c5ezQLC).

3. **3D Printing**: At this moment, 3D printing of custom keycaps for Cherry MX ULP switches requires additional, more detailed datasheets directly from Cherry. Despite this, there have been successful attempts at creating 3D printed keycaps:

- HS – height of a keycap with a switch
- HPS – height of a keycap with a pressed switch
- S – spacing, distance between keycaps

### Removing Keycaps Without Damage

To get a 1u keycap from a switch without causing too much damage, follow these steps:

- Gently pry off from the bottom left side and then the bottom right side using tweezers.
- To reduce the potential for damage, gently push the keycap from the opposite side using your fingertip.
- The keycap should be free from one side with a click sound, and then you can take it off the switch.

Non-1u keys are a bit trickier because they may use stabilizer bars and additional stabilizers, but the principle stays the same.
